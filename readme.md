# 🏅 Olympic Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Overview

The **Olympic Data Analytics Project** focuses on performing comprehensive data analysis using Olympic data, structured around the **Medallion Architecture** — **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.

This architecture enables efficient data **ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and aggregation** using **Databricks** and **PySpark**.  
The goal is to visualize key insights and build a **scalable, efficient data pipeline** for Olympic datasets.
